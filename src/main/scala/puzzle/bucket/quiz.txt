You have a 12-gallon puzzle.bucket, an 8-gallon puzzle.bucket and a 5-gallon puzzle.bucket.
The 12-gallon puzzle.bucket is full of water and the other two are empty.
Without using any additional water how can you divide the twelve gallons of water equally
so that two of the three buckets have exactly 6 gallons of water in them?
